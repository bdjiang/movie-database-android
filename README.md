# movie-database-android

Simple Android application that displays the top 50 most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Uses Google's GSON to parse the JSON that TMDb gives, and populates the app entries (using RecyclerView) with that info.

Skeleton code only; omitted external libraries and various Android dependencies required to compile.
