# movie-database-android

Simple Android application that displays the top 50 most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Uses Google's GSON to parse the JSON that TMDb gives, and populates the app entries (using RecyclerView) with that info.

Skeleton code only; omitted external libraries and various Android dependencies required to compile.

APK file is available to install, but will not run on modern devices due to the current version of Google Play Protect blocking installation of the app. Works on an emulator
